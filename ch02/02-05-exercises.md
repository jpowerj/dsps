# Exercise 2.5.34

Three prisoners $A$, $B$, and $C$ on death row know that exactly two of them are going to be executed, but they do not know which two. Prisoner $A$ knows that the jailer will not tell him whether or not he is going to be executed. He therefore asks the jailer to tell him the name of one prisoner other than $A$ himself who will be executed. The jailer responds that $B$ will be executed. Upon receiving this response, Prisoner $A$ reasons as follows: Before he spoke to the jailer, the probability was $2/3$ that he would be one of the two prisoners executed. After speaking to the jailer, he knows that either he or prisoner $C$ will be the other one to be executed. Hence, the probability that he will be executed is now only $1/2$. Thus, merely by asking the jailer his question, the prisoner reduced the probability that he would be executed from $2/3$ to $1/2$, because he could go through exactly this same reasoning regardless of which answer the jailer gave. Discuss what is wrong with prisoner $A$'s reasoning.

# Exercise 2.5.35

Suppose that each of two gamblers $A$ and $B$ has an initial fortune of 50 dollars, and that there is probability $p$ that gambler $A$ will win on any single play of a game against gambler $B$. Also, suppose either that one gambler can win one dollar from the other on each play of the game or that they can double the stakes and one can win two dollars from the other on each play of the game. Under which of these two conditions does $A$ have the greater probability of winning the initial fortune of $B$ before losing her own for each of the following conditions: **(a)** $p < 1/2$; **(b)** $p > 1/2$; **(c)** $p = 1/2$?

# Exercise 2.5.36

A sequence of $n$ job candidates is prepared to interview for a job. We would like to hire the best candidate, but we have no information to distinguish the candidates before we interview them. We assume that the best candidate is equally likely to be each of the $n$ candidates in the sequence before the interviews start. After the interviews start, we are able to rank those candidates we have seen, but we have no information about where the remaining candidates rank relative to those we have seen. After each interview, it is required that either we hire the current candidate immediately and stop the interviews, or we must let the current candidate go and we never can call them back. We choose to interview as follows: We select a number $0 \leq r < n$ and we interview the first $r$ candidates without any intention of hiring them. Starting with the next candidate $r + 1$, we continue interviewing until the current candidate is the best we have seen so far. We then stop and hire the current candidate. If none of the candidates from $r + 1$ to $n$ is the best, we just hire candidate $n$. We would like to compute the probability that we hire the best candidate and we would like to choose $r$ to make this probability as large as possible. Let $A$ be the event that we hire the best candidate, and let $B_i$ be the event that the best candidate is in position $i$ in the sequence of interviews.

a. Let $i > r$. Find the probability that the candidate who is relatively the best among the first $i$ interviewed appears in the first $r$ interviews.
b. Prove that $\Pr(A \mid B_i) = 0$ for $i \leq r$ and $\Pr(A \mid B_i) = r/(i − 1)$ for $i > r$.
c. For fixed $r$, let $p_r$ be the probability of $A$ using that value of $r$. Prove that $p_r = (r/n)\sum_{i=r+1}^{n}(i-1)^{-1}$.
d. Let $q_r = p_r − p_{r−1}$ for $r = 1, \ldots, n - 1$, and prove that $q_r$ is a strictly decreasing function of $r$.
e. Show that a value of $r$ that maximizes $p_r$ is the last $r$ such that $q_r > 0$. (*Hint*: Write $p_r = p_0 + q_1 + \cdots + q_r$ for $r > 0$.)
f. For $n = 10$, find the value of $r$ that maximizes $p_r$, and find the corresponding $p_r$ value.
